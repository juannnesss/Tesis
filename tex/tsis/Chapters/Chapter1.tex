Taking a photograph of an object, traditionally, we need to face a camara (detector) to the object. But with two-photon imaging 
we use a detector that is towards the light source, rather than towards the object.
As the name suggest it, we also use the information about another photon that is strongly correlated. (IMAGE)
 Two-photon is reproduced at quantum level by a non-factorizable point-to-point image-forming correlation between two photons.

Two-photon imaging has been demonstrated using two types of light sources. Type-one
two-photon imaging uses entangled photon pairs as the light source. In 1995 Pittman, realized a 
quantum two-photon geometric optical effect.  They have successfully performed optical 
imaging by means of a quantum-mechanical entangled source\cite{pittman}.

Type-two of imaging uses chaotic light. The type-two  
image-forming correlation is caused by the superposition between paired two-photon amplitudes,
or the symmetrized effective two-photon wave-function\cite{physicsGhost}.
\section{Imaging}

Assuming we have an object that have its own light or its externally illuminated,
imaging means collecting that light that is emitted from the object. Each point
of the surface od the object will emit spherical waves to all possible directions,
been this said, What is the probability to have a spherical wave collapsing into a point or small spot? 
Obviously, the chance is practically zero unless an imaging system is applied.
\\
The concept of optical imaging was well developed in classical optics and the Figure
\ref{fig:imaging} schematically illustrates a standar imaging setup. In this setup 
an object is illuminated by a radiation source, an imaging lens is used 
to focus the scattered and reflected light from the object onto an image plane 
which is defined by the “Gaussian thin lens equation”\cite{hecht}:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{s_0}+\frac{1}{s_i}=\frac{1}{f}
\end{equation}
 where $s_0$ is the distance between the object and the imaging lens, $s_i$ the distance 
between the imaging lens and the image plane, and $f$ the focal lenght of the imaging lens. This equation defines
a point-to-point relationship between the object plane and the image plane: any radiation starting from a point on the object will colapse at a certain point at the image plane.

by the Gaussian thin-lens equation $\frac{1}{l}+\frac{1}{f+d}=\frac{1}{f}$} 
\label{fig:imaging}
\end{figure}
This one-to-one correspondence in the image-forming relationship between the object and the image planes produces a perfect image.
The observed image can be magnified or demagnified, for example, in the 
Figure \ref{fig:imaging} the original object is a tree, and it is demagnified at the image plane. This depends on which optical 
system are we using, what kind on lenses are involved and the distance between object and them.

\section{Two-Photon Imaging}
Two-photon imaging consist after all, in reconstructing an image of an object. But in this case we use two dectector located in diferents paths of the light. By using the dectections of them separately we get a constant signal, with no information about the object, Figure \ref{fig:twoPhotonSetup}. But if instead we use the signal of them both, counting conincidences, we can reconstruct the double slit in Figure \ref{fig:twoPhotonSetup}. \\

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/twoPhotonSetup.png}
\caption{Simple schematic for the Two-photon Imaging} 
\label{fig:twoPhotonSetup}
\end{figure}
In order to reconstruct the image of the double slit, we have to introduce some kind of spatial dependence, the object, in this case the double slit, is distributed along a transverse direction of the light propagation. But what we have learnt is that scanning along the x-direction (asuming that light propagates along the z-direction), in the path that have no interaction with the object $D_2$, and colecting all the light that interacts with the object $D_1$, gathering no spatial information. We reconstruct the double slit in the coincidences counts, every time we have a photon detected going througt the double slit, and a photon at a certaint position $x_i$, we graph coincidences vs ${ x_i }$ and we get the image of the double slit, Figure \ref{fig:twoPhotonSetup}. 

\subsection{Two-Photon Imaging using entangled photon pairs}

In the previous section we introduced the notion of two-photon imaging , but we didn't care much about the nature of the source light. For this case we will use entangled photon as the source light, we will separate the pair of entangled photons by means of a polarization beamspliter. The first type-one two-photon imaging experiment was demonstrated by Pittman in 1995\cite{pittman}. The schematic setup of the experiment is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:pittman}. \\ 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Figures/pittman.png}
\caption{Schematic of the first "two-photon imaging" experimental setup, used by Pittman\cite{pittman}} 
\label{fig:pittman}
\end{figure}
A continuous wave (CW) laser is used to pump a nonlinear 
crystal to produce pairs of entangled photons. This pairs of orthogonally polarized signal and idler photons are the product
of the nonlinear optical process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).
The pair emerges from the crystal collinearly\footnote{The pairs emerge from the crystal nearly 
collinearly, with $\omega_s \simeq \omega_i \simeq \omega_p / 2$. where the subscript
letter stands for signal, idler and pump respectively}, it is separated by a dispersion prism, 
and then the signal and idler are sent in different directions by a polarization
beam slitting Glan-Thompson prism. 

The reflected signal beam passes through a 
convex lens with a $400mm$ focal length and illuminates an aperture\footnote{The aperture 
consisted of the letters UMBC, University of Maryland Baltimore County.}.
Before the aperture is placed a filter (Figure \ref{fig:signal}), 
this is a bandwidth spectral filters centered at the
wavelength $702.2 nm$. 
Behind the aperture is the detector package $D_1$. \\
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.24\textwidth]{Figures/signal.png}
\caption{The reflected photon, called signal} 
\label{fig:signal}
\end{figure}


The transmitted idler beam is met by detector 
package $D_2$. The input tip of the fiber is scanned in the transverse 
plane. The counts are sent to a coincidence 
counting circuit with a $1.8ns$ acceptance window.


An important fact of this experiment is the use of a lens(collection lens) in the signal beam that establishes an image plane with the definitive point-by-point correspondence object(mask) plane.




\subsection{Two-photon Imaging Using Thermal Sources}

In \cite{thermal} they compared ghost Imaging using entanglement versus Classical correlated light. read and information in \cite{thermalAlejandra}. here i talk about coherence and intensity fluctuations \cite{intensity}

It is possible to establish an analogy
between classical optics and entangled two-photon optics:
the two-photon probability amplitude plays in entangled
two-photon processes the same role that the complex amplitude
of the electric field plays in classical optics  \cite{thermalAlejandra}.
