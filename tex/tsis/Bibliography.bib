  abstract={In most configurations aimed at generating entangled photons based on spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the generated pairs of photons are required to be entangled in only one degree of freedom. Any distinguishing information coming from the other degrees of freedom that characterize the photon should be suppressed to avoid correlations with the degree of freedom of interest. However, this suppression is not always possible. Here, we show how the frequency information available affects the purity of the two-photon state in space, revealing a correlation between the frequency and the space degrees of freedom. This correlation should be taken into account to calculate the total amount of entanglement between the photons.}

abstract = {In this Letter, we present a theoretical and experimental study about the spatial correlations of paired photons generated by Type II spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In particular, we show how these correlations can be positive or negative, depending on the direction in which the far-field plane is scanned and the polarization postselected. Our results provide a straightforward way to observe different kind of correlations that complement other well-known methods to tune the spatial correlations of paired photons.}

abstract="Ghost images are obtained by correlating the output of a single-pixel (bucket) photodetector---which collects light that has been transmitted through or reflected from an object---with the output from a high spatial-resolution scanning photodetector or photodetector array whose illumination has not interacted with that object. The term ``ghost image'' is apt because neither detector's output alone can yield an image: the bucket detector has no spatial resolution, while the high spatial-resolution detector has not viewed the object. The first ghost imaging experiment relied on the entangled signal and idler outputs from a spontaneous parametric downconverter, and hence the image was interpreted as a quantum phenomenon. Subsequent theory and experiments showed, however, that classical correlations can be used to form ghost images. For example, ghost images can be formed with pseudothermal light, for which quantum mechanics is not required to characterize its photodetection statistics. This paper presents an overview of the physics of ghost imaging. It clarifies and unites two disparate interpretations of pseudothermal ghost imaging---two-photon interference and classical intensity-fluctuation correlations---that had previously been thought to be conflicting. It also reviews recent work on ghost imaging in reflection, ghost imaging through atmospheric turbulence, computational ghost imaging, and two-color ghost imaging.",
