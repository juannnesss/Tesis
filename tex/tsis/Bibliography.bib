  abstract={In most configurations aimed at generating entangled photons based on spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), the generated pairs of photons are required to be entangled in only one degree of freedom. Any distinguishing information coming from the other degrees of freedom that characterize the photon should be suppressed to avoid correlations with the degree of freedom of interest. However, this suppression is not always possible. Here, we show how the frequency information available affects the purity of the two-photon state in space, revealing a correlation between the frequency and the space degrees of freedom. This correlation should be taken into account to calculate the total amount of entanglement between the photons.}

abstract = {In this Letter, we present a theoretical and experimental study about the spatial correlations of paired photons generated by Type II spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In particular, we show how these correlations can be positive or negative, depending on the direction in which the far-field plane is scanned and the polarization postselected. Our results provide a straightforward way to observe different kind of correlations that complement other well-known methods to tune the spatial correlations of paired photons.}
